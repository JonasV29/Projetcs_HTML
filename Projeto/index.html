             <h2>Hardware</h2>
                 <p> Hardware is the physical part of a computer. It is in him that
                    everything works, which stores the data, processes and reads what we do
                    on the computer, because the computer actually has its own language
                    which would be the binary language(0 and 1). One of the computer mechanics
                    best known would be the processor, it behaves as if it were the brain
                    from the computer.</p>
           
             <h2>Monitor</h2>
                  <p>The monitor is responsible for showing us what we are doing in the
                    computer, it mirrors everything that happens, as if the monitor would be
                    what we are watching and the Hardware would be the employees who would do
                    broadcast on television.</p> 
                  
             <h2>Operacional System</h2>
           
            <p> The Operating System is what works with the computer's hardware,
             he is responsible for managing and managing all the resources of a system
             from a computer. <br> </p>
